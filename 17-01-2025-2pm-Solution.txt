function: list, map : store 

list : time, bool, shorlen -key 

1- hit 
0 - 24 - no hits 
 url : shortenUrl -- list with time.now bool 0 

 redirectUrl : if user tries rediect database ---> boolean value to the 1 if no is 0 
 if redirect boolean 1 time =time.now() at redriect time 

 go routine 
 function to check list hitornot 

 presenttime =time.now()
 for -- range list

if hitornot 1 0

list=created-== 24 hours 

shortenurl

request 17 jan 12:00pm created 0
17 jan 1:00 am 1
17 jan 2 am 0
18 2 am 



modified Solution 


ShortenUrl ===> create the log with createdat,shorten url 
redirecturl ===> if request then modify the createat time to present time it is time.now()

in thread will run for every 1 minute after its previous execution 
steps :
1. checks the present time and createdat time for each url in log list
2. if more than 24 hours then it removes the url from the store and also from the clickstore 
3. update the logstore 
4. if not just update the logstore
